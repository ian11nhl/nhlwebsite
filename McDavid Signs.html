    <hr>
    <p>Connor McDavid signed a two-year, $25 million contract with the Edmonton Oilers on Monday. It has an average annual value of $12.5 million and begins with the 2026-27 season.

The 28-year-old center is entering the last of an eight-year, $100 million contract ($12.5 million AAV) he signed July 5, 2017. He led the Oilers to their second straight appearance in the Stanley Cup Final last season, where they again lost to the Florida Panthers. He tied teammate Leon Draisaitl for the NHL scoring lead in the Stanley Cup Playoffs with 33 points (seven goals, 26 assists) in 22 games.

Our journey here continues, McDavid said on X before the deal was announced.</p>
